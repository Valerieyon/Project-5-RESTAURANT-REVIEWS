#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews Stage 1_

### Background
Restaurant reviews is a simple web application that shows a list of available restaurants in an area. All restaurants are geolocated within a map and they can be filtered by the neighborhood and/or cuisine filter options.
When clicked the "View details" button, additional information will be shown.

### Installation
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. Spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 or python -m http.server 8000.
3. Click open index.html.

### Steps of creating
1. First I added Google Map API and replaced the default MapBox API.
2. Then I added some meta tags and changed the css styling, added Media Queries for more responsive page.
3. Next is to make the app more accessible by editing the tabIndex etc.
4. Then is the most difficult part, setting up service worker to cache the data in order to work offline.




### Note about ES6
Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future-proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
